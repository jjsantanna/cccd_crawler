The accusations that he attempted to blackmail Lloyds and Barclays banks after committing denial of service attacks were subsequently dropped by the prosecution. He pleaded guilty two offences against the Computer Misuse Act and one charge of possessing criminal property, which related to the denial of service attacks against Lonestar MTN. He had been working for a rival Liberian network provider when he conducted denial of service attacks against Lonestar MTN, first using rented botnets and booter services, and then his own Mirai botnet. Lonestar Cell MTN revealed that it was experiencing unprecedented and repeated denial of service attacks, which disabled internet access across Liberia. He had been arrested in the UK and extradited to Germany, where he received a suspended sentence for an attack against Deutsche Telekom. He was then extradited back to the UK following an investigation by the National Crime Agency.\n",

       "18     He was originally charged with nine offences under the Computer Misuse Act, two of blackmail, one of possession of criminal property, and one charge that he endangered human welfare with a cyber-attack against Lonestar MTN, Liberiaâs biggest internet provider. The accusations that he attempted to blackmail Lloyds and Barclays banks after committing denial of service attacks were subsequently dropped by the prosecution. He pleaded guilty two offences against the Computer Misuse Act and one charge of possessing criminal property, which related to the denial of service attacks against Lonestar MTN. He had been working for a rival Liberian network provider when he conducted denial of service attacks against Lonestar MTN, first using rented botnets and booter services, and then his own Mirai botnet. Lonestar Cell MTN revealed that it was experiencing unprecedented and repeated denial of service attacks, which disabled internet access across Liberia. He had been arrested in the UK and extradited to Germany, where he received a suspended sentence for an attack against Deutsche Telekom. He was then extradited back to the UK following an investigation by the National Crime Agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "383    Pleaded guilty to 21 counts of unauthorised acts with intent to impair the operation of or access to a computer under Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act. On July 7 and 8, two separate âdenial of serviceâ attacks were launched against the customer-facing websites of two multi-national banks. The attacks disrupted the websites for around 40 minutes on each evening. The previous month, a council website in the north of England had been disrupted for two hours one afternoon using the same tactic. Two days earlier on June 7, a website provider for an advisory service providing advice about family court matters was attacked. The server was flooded with hostile traffic which blocked genuine users of the site for four hours. In total, over 300 websites were taken offline.

       "474    Sentenced in May 2013 for denial of service attack against the University of Cambridge website and posting a bogus Call of Duty patch that was actually a data-stealing Trojan. Charged in November 2012 for separate offences relating to DDoS attacks on Kent Police and Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Charged with 17 counts of computer misuse, including the intriguing one of failing to provide the passwords to encrypted storage devices. Police found details of 300 credit cards in his possession as well as evidence that he had taken out a fraudulent loan using an assumed identity. Police believed he sold card data to foreign criminals for between $1 and $5. Also attempted to steal computer and projector equipment. An appeal against his sentence was dismissed in August 2013. Pleaded guilty 3 September 2014 to blackmail, possession of articles for use in fraud and possession of indecent images of children. In May 2013, Lloyds Banking Group and The Sun newspaper reported an allegation of blackmail to the Metropolitan Policeâs Cyber Crime Unit. The suspect had demanded payment of approximately 207,000 in Bitcoins, the online currency, threatening exposure of thousands of illegally-obtained bank account details if he did not receive payment. Anonymisation software had been used to hide the blackmailerâs identity. A sample of the phished bank accounts was enclosed to demonstrate he was a genuine blackmailer. Compromised personal banking information that could be used in a fraud was also found along with three malware-based phishing programs designed to steal personal details and data. A number of indecent images of children were also discovered which were not connected to the blackmail investigation. Sentenced 28 November 2014.\n",

       "481    Pleaded guilty. Charged with four unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing, the operation of a computer, under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. He wrote a Python script that, when used in combination with a DDoS tool called the âLow Orbit Ion Cannonâ, can be used to send overwhelming amounts of traffic to a website. He used the tool, which had widely been used in attacks perpetrated by the loose-knit group Anonymous, to carry out a denial of service attack against the Metropolitan Police Service website. There are also allegations that he took advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in the website of a major bank and entertainment company, gaining internal access to their systems.
